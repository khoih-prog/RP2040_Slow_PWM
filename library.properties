sentence=This library enables you to use ISR-based PWM channels on RP2040-based boards, such as ADAFRUIT_FEATHER_RP2040, RASPBERRY_PI_PICO, with arduino-pico core to create and output PWM any GPIO pin. 
paragraph=The most important feature is they are ISR-based PWM channels, supporting lower PWM frequencies with suitable accuracy. Their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions or tasks. This important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks. These ISR-based PWMs, still work even if other software functions are blocking. Moreover, they are much more precise (certainly depending on clock frequency accuracy) than other software-based PWM using millis() or micros(). That is necessary if you need to control devices requiring high precision. Now you can change the PWM settings on-the-fly
